1.1.1 Common types of data sets
To read a chart, you don't need to be an expert in databases or spreadsheets. But with a small amount of data knowledge, you'll feel more at ease in the world of data. 

After the connection, Tableau reads the data and assigns a data type to each field (see orange box).

Users verify that Tableau has correctly assigned data types, and they can make changes on the Data Source page if the data type is wrong. They can also rename unclear or misspelled fields.

Any changes made in Tableau are not written to the native data source. Changes are instead stored as metadata in a Tableau file called a Tableau Data Source, or .tds.

After connecting to data and adjusting the metadata, users can open a sheet to begin building charts, analyzing data, and sharing results.


1.1.2 A closer look at fields
What is a field?
A fields, also known as a column, is a single piece of information from a record in a data set.
For example, if you were to collect data on how many times a week a commuter chose different modes of transportation, your data set could include:

Commuter name, Mode, and Days per week are all fields. Commuter name and Mode are qualitative fields, while Days per week is a quantitative field. 
Commuter 통근자, 출퇴근자

Knowledge check
In a data set, a field named Color that includes members such as red, green, blue, and orange is most likely :
Qualitative
​
A quantitative field is best described as :
A field that contains numerical data.
​
When Tableau connects to data, fields are assigned into two roles:
Dimensions ans Measures​
